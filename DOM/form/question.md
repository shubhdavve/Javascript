# Problem Statement:

We have created a layout with two forms (Signup & Sign in) following specific guidelines, as detailed in the previous instructions. In this phase, we aim to implement functionality for both the "Create Account" button in the Signup form and the "Signin" button in the Signin form.

## Signup Form:
When a user clicks on the "Create Account" button, the form should capture the entered data and store it in an object. The object should have properties corresponding to the input fields (Name, Email Address, Country, Phone, Password).

## Signin Form:
When a user clicks on the "Signin" button, the form should capture the entered data and store it in an object. The object should have properties corresponding to the input fields (Name, Email Address, Password).

Your task is to implement the JavaScript functionality for both forms. Here are the additional requirements:

1. Attach an event listener to the "Create Account" button in the Signup form and the "Signin" button in the Signin form.
2. On button click, retrieve the values entered in each input field of the respective forms.
3. Create an object with properties for Name, Email Address, Country, Phone, and Password (for Signup) or Name, Email Address, and Password (for Signin).
4. Display or log the created object in the console for verification.

Ensure that the JavaScript code is integrated into the HTML file using the script tag.

**General Guidelines:**
- Do not change the existing IDs or classes.
- Follow the specified rules for each element and attribute.
- Use the provided CSS boilerplate in styles.css.
- Implement the JavaScript functionality for capturing data on both "Create Account" and "Signin" button clicks.

Good luck!
